# My First Blog 
### *7/14/2024*
## Introduction

Hi my name is Jonnathan. Get ready to read a most likely mediocre blog post because this is, as you probably read in the title, my first blog post. Moving to the content,
my idea with my first blog post is to speak about my experience creating this blog. To keep it organized I will be dividing them into sections. The first section will 
speak on the why I started a blog. The second section will speak on my plan for the blog and how I accomplished it. The last section will speak about the problems I faced 
and hopefully some helpful insights into solving some problems you might face when creating a blog. 


## Why am I a blogger?
1. **System of success**: There is an amazing quote that goes "you don't rise to the level of you goals, you fall to the level of your systems". My understanding of this quote is I shouln't be 
focusing on achieving the goals I have but instead staying afloat on a path that in time will get me to reaching my goals. A blog will be a part of my system.

2. **Just working on a project**: I'm in college and I want to get better at software developing, outside of internships, working on projects head first is the best method to get better. So I chose a simple project and picked out the technologies I wanted to learn. Those being React-vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind.

3. **Oppurtuntity to show growth**: The vision is my blog will demonstrate where I started and how far I have gone from there. A blog is a great platform to showcase what I have learned overtime and 
what I am currently achieving. It's also a great way for me to work on my writing abilities.

The reason I had thought of making a blog was because of the advice of a successful entrepenuer, formerly a software engineer. His Name is Yasin Ehsan,
I think its only fair I give a thank you to the CEO of Headstarter Yasin Ehsan [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasinehsan/) because without his advice I wouldn't have made this blog. The story goes

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you can start coding, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here's a simple step-by-step guide:

1. **Install a Code Editor**: Popular options include [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Sublime Text, and Atom.
2. **Install Node.js**: This will allow you to run JavaScript on your local machine. Download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
3. **Create a Project Folder**: Organize your work by creating a dedicated folder for your projects.

## Your First JavaScript Program

Let's write a simple JavaScript program to get started. Open your code editor and create a new file called `app.js`. Then, type the following code:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, JavaScript!');
```
