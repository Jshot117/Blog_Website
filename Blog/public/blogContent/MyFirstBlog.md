# My First Blog 
### *7/14/2024*
## Introduction

Hi my name is Jonnathan. Get ready to read a most likely mediocre blog post because this is, as you probably read in the title, my first blog post. Moving to the content,
my idea with my first blog post is to speak about my experience creating this blog. To keep it organized I will be dividing them into sections. The first section will 
speak on the why I started a blog. The second section will speak on my plan for the blog and how I accomplished it. The last section will speak about the problems I faced 
and hopefully some helpful insights into solving some problems you might face when creating a blog. 


## Why am I a blogger?
1. **System of success**: There is a amazing quote that goes "you don't rise to the level of you goals, you fall to the level of your systems". My understanding of this quote is I shouln't be 
focusing on achieving the goals I have but instead staying afloat on a path that in time will get me to reaching my goals. A blog will be a part of my system because no doubt writing what you have learned is a learning tool in itself.

2. **Just working on a project**: 
3. **Career Opportunities**: JavaScript developers are in high demand.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you can start coding, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here's a simple step-by-step guide:

1. **Install a Code Editor**: Popular options include [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Sublime Text, and Atom.
2. **Install Node.js**: This will allow you to run JavaScript on your local machine. Download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
3. **Create a Project Folder**: Organize your work by creating a dedicated folder for your projects.

## Your First JavaScript Program

Let's write a simple JavaScript program to get started. Open your code editor and create a new file called `app.js`. Then, type the following code:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, JavaScript!');
```
